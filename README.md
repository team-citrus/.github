# Team Citrus

A group of some friends who decided one day to make a game.
We'll take all the help we can get, and we'd love to get new members and ideas.

Althought the name and current logo are similar to Team Cherry, the developers of the famous indie game Hollow Knight, we are not related, nor are we trying to rip them off.
No members of Team Citrus have ever met any members of Team Cherry, and we are based in completely different locations.
The logo is temporary until we get a new one.

Our Discord server can be found [here](discord.gg/fbNDPHUBCj).

## Projects

- [Citrus Engine](https://github.com/team-citrus/engine), a game engine originally created for our currently nameless game
